#
# Starting from version 358, the NVIDIA drivers are incompatible with uvesafb
# and will crash your system if you attempt to: (1) change between VTT and X,
# or (2) suspend or hibernate.
#
# You can work around the issue by switching from uvesafb to efifb
# (and optionally simplefb). However, this also requires you to switch from a
# BIOS to a UEFI bootloader and depending on your hardware
# (especially your monitor) it may disable your high-resolution console.
#
# This mask keeps you on the last working "Latest Long Lived Branch" version
# which is 352.79 (25 Jan 2016) and temporarily resolves matters regardless of
# your bootloader.
#
# Feel free to upgrade if you don't use uvesafb.
